# 📐 Spider-Man's Motion Equations

## 🧮 Vector Path
The position of Spider-Man at time `t` is defined by:

Spider-Man swings through the city following a parametric vector path defined by:

r(t) = ⟨ x(t), y(t), z(t) ⟩  
     = ⟨ 10·sin(t), 5·cos(2t), 3t ⟩  

Where:
- t = time (in seconds)
- x(t) controls side-to-side swinging (like a pendulum)
- y(t) controls vertical bounce (web elasticity effect)
- z(t) is forward movement along the city street

This vector function simulates a smooth, periodic swinging motion using trigonometric curves and linear progression.
