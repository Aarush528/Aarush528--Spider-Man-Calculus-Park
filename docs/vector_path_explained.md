This folder holds all resources and equations related to the vector functions used to animate Spider-Manâ€™s motion. It includes parameterized vector equations for swinging, path constraints, and tangent vector calculations. These functions show how physics-inspired vector calculus creates lifelike motion in 3D environments.
