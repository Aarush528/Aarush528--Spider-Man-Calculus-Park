🚀 Spider-Man: Calculus Park – An Interdisciplinary Math & Design Showcase
This project, titled Spider-Man: Calculus Park, is a visually dynamic and mathematically rich 3D model built using GeoGebra's 3D Calculator. Designed as part of the IBDP HL Mathematics exploration, it merges real-world physics, advanced calculus, and imaginative storytelling. The model simulates Spider-Man swinging across a futuristic skyline into a glowing interdimensional portal, with roads, cars, layered animation, and glowing effects — all mathematically constructed.

Vector functions, parametric equations, 3D geometry, and concepts like arc length and curvature are deeply embedded in the model. Each animation and structure is backed by calculated movement and transformations, not merely drawn for aesthetic. This project pushes the limits of what educational math modeling can look like — bringing creativity, technology, and complex mathematics into a single immersive experience.

🔧 Tools Used: GeoGebra 3D, LaTeX (for math rendering), GitHub (for version control), and AI-assisted planning.
📘 Goal: To demonstrate real-world applications of HL Mathematics topics in a way that captivates visually while maintaining academic rigor.

This is not just a math assignment — it’s a 3D narrative built on the foundation of calculus.
