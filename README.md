# 🕸️ Spider-Man: Calculus Park 🧠✨

A 3D Calculus Visualisation project built using [GeoGebra 3D Calculator](https://www.geogebra.org/3d). This model reimagines Spider-Man swinging through a futuristic mathematical park, exploring concepts from **vectors**, **differentiation**, and **kinematics**.

## 🔥 Project Highlights
- 🧮 Used vector functions to simulate Spider-Man’s swinging path
- 🚀 Modeled parabolic and circular motion using real calculus equations
- 🌆 Built a 3D futuristic city with roads, flyovers, buildings, and portals
- 🎆 Added animated glowing trails and portal effects

## 🎓 Educational Relevance
This model was designed as part of the IBDP HL Mathematics project **"Calculus Park"**. The purpose was to make calculus concepts tangible and interactive using 3D animation.

## 📁 Files Included
- `spiderman-model.ggb`: Main GeoGebra file
- `screenshots/`: Project visuals
- `docs/`: Technical and mathematical breakdown
- `extras/`: Creative assets (e.g., Spider-Man pixel art, trails)

## 💡 Inspiration
Spider-Man’s swinging motion is an example of real-life physics, and this project merges that with math to inspire visual learning.

## 🚀 Future Additions
- Motion control sliders
- Time vs. position graphs
- Portal warp simulation
